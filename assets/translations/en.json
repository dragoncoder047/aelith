Because of this it is only possible to capture the system state once using [b]throw[/b]. It must be restored first before another snapshot is saved.\n\nHISTORY\n&tab[b]throw[/b] was originally written as a way for a program to signal to the debugger that something has gone wrong and \"throw\" control back to the human operator.

When invoked via [setjmp]longjmp[/setjmp], it jumps back to the place it was captured from -- no matter how many stack frames it must jump through -- and then restores the value of local variables.\n\nCAVEATS\n&tab[b]setjmp[/b] can only unwind the call stack, so trying to capture a second continuation while one is still active is undefined behavior. To prevent this from happening, when [setjmp]setjmp[/setjmp] detects that a continuation has already been captured, it turns off until the existing continuation is invoked.\n\n&tabAdditionally, if a local variable can not be found when the [setjmp]longjmp[/setjmp] is called, [setjmp]setjmp[/setjmp] will attempt to re-create it. This is a relatively new addition, and has not been debugged thouroughly, so using [setjmp]setjmp[/setjmp] in this manner may cause additional glitches.\n\nHISTORY\n&tab[b]setjmp[/b] was introduced by the [b]C89[/b] standard. While no other programming language implements [b]setjmp[/b] under the same name, other programming languages do setjmp'ing in their C implementations to implement other exotic control flow structures."
