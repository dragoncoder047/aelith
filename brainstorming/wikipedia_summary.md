## Gameplay

*Aelith* is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania. The player controls a silent and nameless robotic alien protagonist who crash-lands on a lifeless planet and explores an abandoned datacenter and research outpost called the Aelith, in search of parts to repair their broken spaceship. Along their way they are accompanied by a floating AI robot companion named NIC, who provides commentary and comic relief throughout the game.

Within the Aelith, the player finds a tool called a "vurbilizer" that allows them to spawn "vurble spores" at will. Once spawned, a vurble spore is able to teleport the player on command back to the point where it was spawned, as well as cause interactable items such as doors to return to the same state (closed or open) they were in when the spore was captured. Crucially, the spores do not affect anything else linked when they revert the state of an object. By strategically spawning vurble spores that will restore the state of some objects in a linked group but not others, the player can bypass the security interlocks still present on doors inside the Aelith and access server rooms, research labs, and offices.

In order to upgrade the vurbilizer, the player must collect data files (in the form of 9-track tape spools scattered around) and insert them into a tape reader, which reads the tape and presents its contents to the player. Some (but not all) of the tapes contain short programs which the player can send to a bank of 3D printers which transform the program into a physical component the player can install in their vurbilizer, allowing it to create more powerful vurble spores. The program tapes and the non-program tapes each contain comments, notes, and plans from the people that once staffed and managed the Aelith, that provide information to the player about the Aelith's purpose, growth, and ultimate downfall.

### Vurbilizer

The vurbilizer is a tool that allows the player to manipulate time and space (but mostly time). When the player uses the vurbilizer, it summons a vurble spore containing an internal memory of the state of the environment around it when it was spawned. Using the vurble spore causes it to restore the state of the world, but only the particular bits of state that were initially saved.

The vurbilizer contains a number of "component slots" that the player can install "component" programs into which are able to modify what gets saved in the captured vurble spore. These components can't actually be found physically, but the player can find programs that describe them and then take those tapes to a computer that is hooked up to a 3D printer which then prints the component (NIC will help them the first time).

The components that can be found are, in order of appearance:

0. With no components, the vurbilizer cannot save anything other than the player's position, and the spore can only teleport them back. The vurbilizer also only has one bit of memory, so that capturing a 2nd vurble spore renders the first one useless (using it will do nothing other than spray particles everywhere and make a horrible sound effect).
1. A component that allows the vurbilizer to save the state of machines within a short configurable distance of the usage point, and restores the state of those machines but not restoring anything else linked to them if it wasn't also captured, so that security interlocks can be broken in order to bypass them.
2. A component that allows the vurbilizer to be activated remotely and teleport the captured spore back to the player, while still having the vurbilizer use its own position as the capture origin, allowing the player to get a vurble spore for a location they can't physically get to.
3. A life-support component that prevents the vurble spore from destroying itself the first time it is used.
4. An expanded memory card for the vurbilizer, allowing it to remember an unlimited number of spores, so that two working vurble spores can exist simultaneously.
5. A component that changes the vurble spores so instead of teleporting the player back to where they were when it was captured, it instead leaves the player in place and teleports all the captured movable objects to the same relative offset as they were when the vurble spore was captured, allowing the player to move large items or sneak things past security systems.
6. A component that lets the spores clone objects that are out of range.
7. A component that makes the spore *not* remember who captured the vurble spore, so instead of teleporting the entity that created the vurble spore, it teleports the entity who triggers it.
8. A component that allows the player to use the vurbilizer to select exactly which objects should be captured, instead of just those within a radius.
9. A component that injects noise into the spore's data so that when it is triggered it restores boolean states to the opposite of what they were when the spore was created.

## Plot

The game begins with the player crash-landing in the middle of a rocky desert. NIC, who was damaged in the crash, reboots and runs a pre-programmed introduction sequence. After NIC finishes booting and returns to their normal personality, they examine the wrecked spaceship and inform the player that three key parts of it -- the antimatter battery, the warp compressor, and the hyperwave relay -- are damaged beyond repair, and the player must find or construct replacements in order to repair their spaceship. NIC does not know at all how or where to start for any of them, but wonders if the "Dr. E" that he and the player were sent to meet decades ago had anything to do with this, and laments that they'll never know now that Dr. E is in prison.

Upon venturing out into the world, the player almost immediately discovers the entrance door to the Aelith, which is buried in the side of a rocky outcropping. NIC notices the decaying sign and mentions to the player that they vaguely recall that name, but they don't have any more data on it, and can't look anything up until the hyperwave relay (which provides internet connectivity) is fixed. As there isn't much else on the surface in the way of spare parts, the player descends into the Aelith. There, they discover the Aelith's computers have been infected with a parasitic slime mold, imbuing them with otherworldly reality-bending capabilities.

By inspecting the many files on tape that are stored around the Aelith, the player and NIC learn that the Aelith was constructed by the Karigossians decades ago, as a research outpost chartered to catalogue and study all of the flora and fauna on the planet. It was staffed by a small team of brave scientists and engineers and chaired by a man named Zylox, and he was given (mostly) free reign over how he would run the Aelith, on the condition that all of their discoveries and inventions as a result of the work at the Aelith be put in the public domain rather than being patented. They first discovered the zug, a silicon-based insect-like animal, and the vurble, a symbiotic bioluminescent multicolored slime mold, that both thrive deep within the caves beneath the Aelith.

Things go well until a vurble manages to climb up the Aelith's trash chute and absorb itself deep into a computer. When a technician runs her programs on the infected computer, rather than running normally, it stops at a specific instruction and spawns a vurble spore out of the computer. Zylox finds that the spores are a biological manifestation of the infected computer's surroundings at the time it was spawned, and squishing it in the right way causes it to quantum-collapse the current world state to match the one it has in its memory. Zylox realizes he can exploit this, and so he brings up many more vurbles from the caves and begins researching how they work.

This research leads to Zylox inventing all three of the player's spaceship's key components -- the antimatter battery, the warp compressor, and the hyperwave relay -- and the Aelith turns into a trading hub, with Zylox building and selling these powerful modules to companies back on Karigos and beyond. Even though Zylox makes all of the blueprints and diagrams for the modules available for free on the Aelith's website for anyone to download, all of the other scientists and engineers accuse Zylox of breaking the Aelith's charter by seeking profit, and resign in protest, leaving only Zylox. Nevertheless, he continues his work solo.

The Aelith's latest product using newly-miniaturized versions of Zylox's modules is the Lith Agent, a floating AI robot programmed to help its owner by performing analysis and investigation of whatever the owner is dealing with, or anything else that the owner wants help with. (When the player discovers the files announcing the Lith Agent's release, NIC realizes that they are a stock-built Lith Agent, and becomes sullen, now that they know they are not unique.)

After the debut of the Lith Agent, Zylox is secretly contacted by the Karigossian mafia, who offer to pay Zylox to create a robot explorer more powerful than a Lith Agent, with the capability to devise new ideas, make decisions, and travel to unknown places on its own, but they demand that Zylox not release this robot to the public. In exchange for secrecy, they offer a share of their revenue generated by the Explorer's discoveries (and crimes). Zylox initially refuses, but after receiving death threats from the mafia, he relents and creates the Explorer. Secretly, he vows to sabotage the mafia by giving the Explorer a strong desire to prevent harm to anyone or anything. Additionally, to make sure that nothing would go wrong with his plan, Zylox called the Karigossian police's anonymous tip line and informed them of the plan. He sent the Explorer off to go to Karigos with NIC, with the only instruction to meet a secret contact named Dr. E.

Soon, the "police" call Zylox back, congratulate him on the Explorer's success in exposing the mafia and delivering them directly into the hands of law enforcement, and invite Zylox to speak at the press conference. Zylox is surprised at the swift success, and agrees to speak to the press. He leaves and never returns. Unfortunately, the call record is the last full communication that the player finds stored in the Aelith and the story goes cold. After that, the player finds some old notes explaining that the vurbilizer was going to be Zylox's next product after the Lith Agent, but beyond that, only unfulfilled orders and unresponded-to messages and nothing else from Zylox. When the player reaches this point, NIC begins to worry why Zylox suddenly vanished without a trace.

Down in the caves where the trash chute led, the player finds the last remaining pieces needed to fix and fuel the powerful 3D printers that can manufacture 2 of the 3 components of their broken spaceship, and after doing so, the player returns to the surface and fixes it, but the blueprint for the hyperwave relay remains hidden.

Eventually, the player is able to break into Zylox's office, and find not only the blueprint, but a working hyperwave relay installed in his PC. Now able to connect to the internet, NIC searches for recent news regarding the fate of the Explorer and the Karigossian mafia, and learns that the Explorer never actually arrived on Karigos. The (real) police hold a press conference and inform the public that they caught the mafia red-handed murdering Zylox, and so the mafia have been arrested and will be tried for their crimes; not only for murder, but also for impersonating the police.

When asked for a full timeline, the police hold up a blueprint of the Explorer that they found on Zylox's body (revealing that the player is the Explorer), and explain that the mafia posed as the police in the phone call to Zylox, and the "press conference" they invited him to was actually a trap. Dr. E was a mafia man, and the police have notified the Explorer of his arrest and incarceration. In the decades since Zylox's death, the Aelith has been all but forgotten.

Now that the player knows where they came from and what they were designed for, NIC encourages them to continue exploring the universe and continue to make discoveries and carry the legacy of Zylox forward. As the player lifts off in their spaceship, NIC breaks the fourth wall by noticing the camera and crashing into it, causing the game to end in a Windows blue screen of death.
