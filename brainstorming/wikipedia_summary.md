## Gameplay

*Aelith* is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania. The player controls a silent and nameless robotic alien protagonist who crash-lands on a lifeless planet and explores an abandoned datacenter and research outpost called the Aelith, in search for parts to repair their broken spaceship. Along their way they are accompanied by a floating AI robot companion named NIC, who provides commentary and comic relief throughout the game.

Within the Aelith, the player is able to construct tools called "vurbilizers" that allow them to spawn "vurble spores" at will. Once spawned, a vurble spore is able to teleport the player on command back to the point where it was spawned in, as well as cause interactable items such as doors to return to the same state (closed or open) they were in when the spore was captured. Crucially, the spores do not affect anything else linked when they revert the state of an object. By strategically spawning vurble spores that will restore the state of some objects in a linked group but not others, the player can bypass the security interlocks still present on doors inside the Aelith and access server rooms, research labs, and offices.

In order to construct the vurbilizers, the player must collect data files (in the form of 9-track tape spools scattered around) and insert them into a tape reader, which reads the tape and presents its contents to the player. Some (but not all) of the tapes contain short programs which the player can run after reading them, and these are what create the vurbilizers that the player can collect. The program tapes and the non-program tapes each contain comments, notes, and plans from the people that once staffed and managed the Aelith, that provide information to the player about the Aelith's purpose, growth, and ultimate downfall.

## Plot

The game begins with the player crash-landing in the middle of a rocky desert. NIC, who was damaged in the crash, reboots and runs a pre-programmed introduction sequence. After NIC finishes booting and returns to their normal personality, they examine the wrecked spaceship and inform the player that three key parts of it -- the antimatter battery, the warp compressor, and the hyperwave relay -- are damaged beyond repair, and the player must find or construct replacements.

Upon venturing out into the world, the player almost immediately discovers the entrance door to the Aelith, which is buried in the side of a rocky outcropping. NIC notices the decaying sign and mentions to the player that they vaguely recall that name, but they don't have any more data on it, and can't look anything up until the hyperwave relay (which provides internet connectivity) is fixed. As there isn't much else on the surface in the way of spare parts, the player descends into the Aelith. There, they discover the Aelith's computers have been infected with a parasitic slime mold, imbibing them with otherworldly reality-bending capabilities.

Through inspecting the many files on tape that are stored around the Aelith, the player and NIC learn that the Aelith was constructed by the Karigossians decades ago, as a research outpost chartered to catalogue and study all of the flora and fauna on the planet. It was staffed by one brave scientist named Zylox, and he was given (mostly) free reign over how he would run the Aelith, on the condition that all of his discoveries and inventions as a result of his work at the Aelith be made public domain. He first discovered the zug, a silicon-based insect-like animal, and the vurble, a symbiotic bioluminescent multicolored slime mold, that both thrive deep within the caves beneath the Aelith.

Things go well until a vurble manages to climb up the Aelith's trash chute and absorb itself deep into a computer. When Zylox runs his programs on the infected computer, rather than running normally, it stops at a specific instruction and spawns a vurble spore out of the computer. Zylox finds that the spores are a biological manifestation of the infected computer's surroundings at the time it was spawned, and squishing it in the right way causes it to quantum-collapse the current world state to match the one it has in its memory. Zylox realizes he can exploit this, and so he brings up many more vurbles from the caves and begin researching how they work.

This research leads to Zylox inventing all three of the player's spaceship's key components -- the antimatter battery, the warp compressor, and the hyperwave relay -- and the Aelith turns into a trading hub, with Zylox building and selling these powerful modules to companies back on Karigos and beyond. The Aelith's latest product using newly-miniaturized versions of those modules is the Lith Agent, a floating AI robot programmed to help its owner by performing analysis and investigation of whatever the owner is dealing with, or really anything else that the owner wants help on. (When the player discovers the files announcing the Lith Agent's release, NIC realizes that they are a stock-built Lith Agent, and becomes sullen, now that they know they are not unique.)

After the debut of the Lith Agent, Zylox is secretly contacted by the Karigossian mafia, who offer to pay Zylox to create a robot explorer more powerful than a Lith Agent, with the capability to devise new ideas, make decisions, and travel to unknown places on its own, but they demand that Zylox not release this robot to the public. In exchange for secrecy, they offer a share of their revenue generated by the Explorer's discoveries (and crimes). Zylox initially refuses, but after receiving death threats from the mafia, he relents and creates the Explorer. Secretly, he vows to sabotage the mafia by giving the Explorer a strong desire to prevent harm to anyone or anything.

Zylox delivers the Explorer, and within days, receives a letter from the Karigossian police congratulating him on doing something they had been struggling to do for decades, as the Explorer had just led the mafia's leadership straight into the hands of law enforcement. The police invite Zylox to return to Karigos to be interviewed as an expert witness in the mafia's group trial. Unfortunately, Zylox's RSVP is the last full communication that the player finds stored in the Aelith and the story reaches a dead end. After that, all the player finds are unfulfilled orders and unresponded-to messages, but nothing else from Zylox. After the player reaches this point, NIC continues to worry why Zylox suddenly vanished without a trace.

Upon finding all three pieces of their spaceship, the player returns to the surface and fixes it. Now able to connect to the internet, NIC searches for recent news regarding the Explorer and the mafia, and learns that they tried to kill the Explorer but were unable to as the Explorer was too powerful, so instead the mafia drove the Explorer from the planet and back into space where it came from. By way of a photo in a news article, it is revealed that the Explorer is the player. The Explorer's actions still provide enough evidence to convict the mafia for their crimes, but sadly the most recent count is for the murder of Zylox. They had intercepted the letter to Zylox and killed him before he could give his testimony. In the decades since his death, the Aelith has been all but forgotten.

Now that the player knows where they came from and what they were designed for, NIC encourages them to continue exploring the universe and continue to make discoveries and carry the legacy of Zylox forward. As the player lifts off in their spaceship, NIC breaks the fourth wall by noticing the camera and crashing into it, causing the game to end in a Windows blue screen of death.
