warning!!

this folder contains notes and AI chat transcripts that I used to ideate and develop the plot and story of Aelith. I only keep them here for my own reference (they are quite out of date and contain old ideas that don't reflect the current lore of Aelith) and to be transparent about how I used AI to help me.

If you read them the story will be spoiled (mostly)!!

If you have not played Aelith, but want to, leave this folder now!!!!!!

however if you want to help develop Aelith, go read wikipedia_summary.md and world_map.md to get a feel for the story and gameplay I am going for.
