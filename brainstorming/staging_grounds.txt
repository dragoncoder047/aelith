I am working on the puzzles in a puzzle platformer game. Here is the description of the game. In the next messages I will send what I have worked on for the actual rooms and puzzles, and what still is left to be designed.

Here is the first half of the rooms document. It is too long for one message (I hope you can internally summarize!)

Here is the 2nd half of the rooms document. There is only one thing left to do:

Component #9 is required to complete the game, but has no blueprint that the player can find or obtain from a puzzle, so they must construct it from the program tapes that they already have. They can construct it using the 'ed' program tape in the server room and the other tapes. However, I have not designed any puzzle to make the player use component #8 in order to obtain the 'ed' tape, however I have decided it will be in the robotics lab. Please help me design it.
