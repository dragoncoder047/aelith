Management has been acting strangely lately. I overheard them discussing the need for "greater control" over the datacenter. What does that even mean? They keep pushing for more features without any clear explanation. I can't shake the feeling that they’re hiding something from us. We need to keep our eyes open and document everything.

# Q3 Plans

## 

file:bug−report.scm

I filed a bug report about the strange behavior of the continuations,
but management dismissed it as "user error." They seem more interested in covering up issues than fixing them.
I’ve noticed that the bugs are becoming more aggressive, and I can’t help but wonder if it’s related to the new features.
I need to gather more evidence before escalating this.

file:junior−concerns.md

The juniors are starting to talk. We’ve all noticed the lack of documentation and the sudden changes in the system. It feels like we’re being set up to fail.
I overheard a few of us discussing the possibility of a cover-up.
We need to stick together and share our findings.
If management is up to something, we need to be ready.

file:security−audit.scm

I conducted a security audit of the new features, and I’m not impressed.
The lack of oversight on the continuations is alarming.
I found several vulnerabilities that could be exploited, but when I brought them up, management brushed me off.
It’s clear they don’t want us digging too deep.
I need to keep this information to myself for now.

file:project−briefing.md

I attended a project briefing today, and it was unsettling.
Management kept emphasizing the need for "efficiency" and "control."
They mentioned something about a "new directive" that we need to follow.
I can’t help but feel that this is more about surveillance than improving our workflow. We need to be cautious about what we share with them.

file:tape−logs.scm

I’ve been going through the tape logs, and they’re full of inconsistencies.
It seems like management is trying to cover their tracks.
I found references to features that were never implemented, and it raises questions about what else they might be hiding.
I need to compile a report and share it with the others.

file:bug−encounter.md

I had a close encounter with one of the bugs today.
It seemed more aggressive than usual, almost like it was reacting to the new features. I can’t help but wonder if the continuations are influencing their behavior.
We need to document these encounters and see if there’s a pattern.

file:feature−request.scm

I submitted a feature request for better documentation, but it was rejected without explanation. Management seems to want us to figure things out on our own, which is frustrating. I suspect they’re trying to keep us in the dark about the real purpose of these features.

file:team−meeting.md

We had a team meeting today, and the atmosphere was tense.
Everyone is on edge, and it’s clear that we’re all feeling the pressure.
I brought up my concerns about the new features, but management dismissed them as paranoia. We need to find a way to communicate without raising suspicion.

file:final−warning.scm

This is my final warning to anyone who reads this.
I’ve seen things that I can’t explain, and I fear for our safety.
Management is not what they seem, and I believe they’re hiding something dangerous. If you find this, take it seriously and be careful.
We need to protect ourselves and each other.
