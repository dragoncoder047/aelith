* the unscii and unscii-mcr fonts are by Viznut, <http://viznut.fi/unscii/> - GPL and CC0 respectively

* the Galactico font is by Juan Miguel Castillo, <https://www.1001fonts.com/galactico-font.html> - ARR, but free for commercial use (but I have no plans to monetize Aelith)

* the Big Space font is by Nurf Designs, <https://www.fontspace.com/big-space-font-f32275> - ARR, free for "personal use only" (I guess this means no monetization without a paid license, but that's the plan...)
