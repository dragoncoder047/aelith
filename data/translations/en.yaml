  firefoxBug: >-
    You appear to be using Firefox. Unfortunately for you, Firefox's
    implementation of the web game controller API is so horribly messed up as to
    be unusable. You can continue with your mouse and keyboard.


    If you really want to use a game controller, please use another browser like
    Chrome$switch(&os~mac:, Opera, or Safari~windows:, Opera, or Microsoft
    Edge~linux: or Opera).
  joycon: >-
    You appear to have connected a single Joy-Con controller, which does not
    have enough buttons to play this game. You can try connecting the other
    Joy-Con, or just use your mouse and keyboard.
  touch: >-
    This game does not support touchscreen controls. Try connecting a game
    controller or a mouse and keyboard.
