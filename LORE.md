> **continuation**: (noun) a small, parasitic animal, *functionus schemus*, that lives in the circuit boards of computers. Infected devices show the curious symptom of being able to run the programming language Scheme. Despite being extremely easy to catch using the right trap (the two leading models are called *setjmp* and *call/cc*), few people thoroughly understand how continuations work inside. What is known is that they display a very interesting and useful property once caught: when they are fed, they instantly teleport back to the exact place where they were initially caught and then barf up what they were fed. This process can be repeated indefinitely with mature continuations. With the juvenile continuations (called "continulets") this process can only be repeated once. The reader should be cautioned that feeding a continulet caught using a *setjmp* trap twice will usually cause irreversible tears in spacetime.

I left a lot of stuff out because at the time I wrote this document the game had already been in development for almost a year without any kind of formal planning. I stopped developing the game during the time that I wrote this, so the game itself may be actually more out-of-date than this.

## SPOILERS AHEAD

<summary>yes spoil the story</summary>

You dusted off an old computer terminal and found that there's a whole mainframe hooked up to it. And the program it was running had... evolved. By itself.

Upon logging into the mainframe, the computer greets you and admits it was unplugged suddenly, so it didn't have a chance to shut down properly last time. As a result, the only data it has is that (a) it was in the middle of creating a videogame, and (b) whatever state it had retained is now corrupted, and the shattered fragments of the code have been strewn all over the file system in varying states of deallocation and dependency errors. Not much left to do other than jump into the system debugger...

Upon starting the debugger you find that the system is fragmented across many different folders, but the computer is at least able to tell you what it last remembers about that folder, and guide you to the next folder.

While exploring, you encounter various blocks of deallocated memory. These contain more data showing what transpired that led up to the computer's hasty shutdown.

In certain parts the filesystem manager has entered a should-be-impossible deadlocked state, and the computer introduces you to a tool it found earlier called a continuation trap. With it you are able to bypass the deadlock.

Along the way the computer points out another type of continuation trap - the system assertion. This is a continuation that will reset the *entire* system back to the way it was previously, as a form of backing up. Hopefully, you will not need to use these.

In the central area you find another, different type of continuation trap, one that lets you completely glitch out the system and actually fix the deadlock. The computer thanks you for fixing that and
